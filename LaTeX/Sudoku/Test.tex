\section{Introduction}
You are required to write a program in the language Python which manages games of "Sudoku", and also presents the user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to play by. Each puzzle will be hard coded and loaded from a text file. There should be three levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard. The game follows the following principle: a square may not hold a number if that number has already been used within that square's row, column or outer square.
